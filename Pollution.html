            <h1>POLLUTION</h1>
        </p>
        <hr color="yellow">
          <p>
           <b> Pollution</b> is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
            Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light).
            <b>Pollutants</b>, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.
            Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants
            have an anthropogenic source  that is, a source created by human activities.</p>
        <p> Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.
            In 2015, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths).
            This remained unchanged in 2019, with little real progress against pollution being identifiable.
            Air pollution accounted for Â¾ of these earlier deaths.

            <h2>Definition and Types</h2>
            <hr color="green">
        </p>
        <p>
            Various definitions of pollution exist, which may or may not recognize certain types, such as noise pollution or greenhouse gases.
            The United States Environmental Protection Administration defines pollution as<b> "Any substances in water, soil,
            or air that degrade the natural quality of the environment, offend the senses of sight, taste, or smell, or cause a health hazard".</b>
            The usefulness of the natural resource is usually impaired by the presence of pollutants and contaminants.
            In contrast, the United Nations considers pollution to be the "presence of substances and heat in environmental media
            (air, water, land) whose nature, location, or quantity produces undesirable environmental effects.
        </p>
        <p>The major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular contaminants relevant to each of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Air%20pollution.html"> Air pollution</a></li><br>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Water%20pollution.html">Water pollution</a></li><br>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Noice%20pollution.html">Noice pollution</a></li><br>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Thermal.html">Thermal pollution</a></li><br>

        <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <hr color="blue">
        <p>
            Pollution has been found to be present widely in the environment. There are a number of effects of this
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>   Biomagnification describes situations where toxins (such as heavy metals) may pass through trophic levels,
            becoming exponentially more concentrated in the process.</li>
        <li>
            Carbon dioxide emissions cause ocean acidification, the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans as CO<sub>2</sub> becomes dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            The emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming which affects ecosystems in many ways.
        </li>
        <li>
            Invasive species can outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. 
            Invasive plants can contribute debris and biomolecules<i> (allelopathy)</i> that can alter soil and chemical compositions of an
            environment, often reducing native species competitiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nitrogen oxides are removed from the air by rain and fertilise land which can change the species composition of ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause acid rain which lowers the pH value of soil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Organic pollution of watercourses can deplete oxygen levels and reduce species diversity.
        </li>
        </ul>

        The<i> Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program</i> (TEHIP) at the United States National<i> Library of Medicine</i> (NLM)
        maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to resources produced by TEHIP
        and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, 
        and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the<i> Toxicology Data Network</i> (TOXNET)
        an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.

        <h2>CONTROL</h2>
        <hr color="red">

        <p>
            Pollution control is a term used in environmental management.
            It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil.
            Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing,
            transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment.
            In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. 
            In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Policy, law and monitoring/transparency/life-cycle assessment-attached economics could be developed and enforced to control
            pollution.
            A review concluded that there is a lack of attention and action such as work on a globally supported
            "formal science policy interface", e.g. to "inform intervention, influence research, and guide funding"

            <p>A litter trap catches floating waste in the<b> Yarra River</b>, east-central Victoria, Australia 
               The lower stretches of the Yarra are where Victoria's state capital Melbourne was established in 1835,
               and today metropolitan Greater Melbourne dominates and influences the landscape of its lower reaches. 
               From its source in the Yarra Ranges, it flows<b> 242 kilometres</b> (150 mi) west through the Yarra Valley which 
               opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne before emptying into Hobsons Bay in northernmost
