    <p>
        <b>Noise pollution</b>, unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health, wildlife, 
        and environmental quality. Noise pollution is commonly generated inside many industrial facilities and some other workplaces, 
        but it also comes from highway, railway, and airplane traffic and from outdoor construction activities.
    </p>
    
    <h3><font color="blue">EFFECTS OF NOICE POLLUTION </font>  </h3>
    <p>
        As well as damaging our hearing by causing — tinnitus or deafness —, constant loud noise can damage human health in many ways, 
        particularly in the very young and the very old. Here are some of the main ones:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Physical</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Respiratory agitation, racing pulse, high blood pressure, headaches and, in case of extremely loud, constant noise, gastritis, 
            colitis and even heart attacks.
        </dd>
        <dt><b> Psychological</b> </dt>
        <dd>
            Noise can cause attacks of stress, fatigue, depression, anxiety and hysteria in both humans and animals.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>  Sleep and behavioural disorders</b></dt>
        <dd>Noise above 45 dB stops you from falling asleep or sleeping properly. 
            Remember that according to the<u><b> World Health Organization</u></b> it should be no more than 30 dB. 
            Loud noise can have latent effects on our behaviour, causing aggressive behav`iour and irritability.</dd>

        <dt><b>Memory and concentration</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Noise may affect people's ability to focus, which can lead to low performance over time. It is also bad for the memory, making it hard to study.

            Interestingly, our ears need more than 16 hours' rest to make up for two hours of exposure to<b> 100 dB</b>.

     <h3><font color="green">SOLUTION TO REDUCE NOICE POLLUTION</font>  </h3>
     <P>
        International bodies like the WHO agree that awareness of noise pollution is essential to beat this invisible enemy. 
        For example: avoid very noisy leisure activities, opt for alternatives means of transport such as bicycles or electric vehicles 
        over taking the car, do your housework at recommended times, insulate homes with noise-absorbing materials, etc. Educating the 
        younger generation is also an essential aspect of environmental education. 
     </P>
     <p>
        Governments can also take measures to ensure correct noise management and reduce noise pollution. 
        For example: protecting certain areas — parts of the countryside, areas of natural interest, city parks, etc. — 
        from noise, establishing regulations that include preventive and corrective measures — mandatory separation 
        between residential zones and sources of noise like airports, fines for exceeding noise limits, etc. —, installing noise 
        insulation in new buildings, creating pedestrian areas where traffic is only allowed to enter to offload goods at certain times, 
        replacing traditional asphalt with more efficient options that can reduce traffic noise by up to<b> 3 dB</b>, among others.
