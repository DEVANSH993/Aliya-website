        <h1>THERMAL POLLUTION</h1>
    </p>
    <hr color="purple">

    <p>
        When someone thinks of pollution, the idea of thermal pollution often doesn’t come to mind. 
        People will first think of things like carbon emissions, personal pollution and waste, and a variety of other changing factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, thermal pollution is a real and persistent problem in our modern society. In layman’s terms, 
        thermal pollution is when an industry or other human-made organization takes in water from a natural source and either 
        cools it down or heats it up. They then eject 
        that water back into the natural resource, which changes the oxygen levels and can have 
        disastrous effects on local ecosystems and communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Thermal pollution</b> is defined as a sudden increase or decrease in the temperature of a natural body of water,
         which may be an ocean, lake, river, or pond, by human influence. 
        This normally occurs when a plant or facility takes in water from a natural resource and puts it back at an altered temperature. 
        Usually, these facilities use it as a cooling method for their machinery or to help better produce their products.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plants that produce different products or wastewater facilities are often the culprits of this massive exodus of thermal pollution. 
        In order to properly control and maintain thermal pollution, humans and governments
         have been taking many steps to effectively manage how plants are able to use the water. However, the effects are still lingering today.

    <h2>CAUSE OF THERMAL POLLUTION</h2>
    <hr color="red">
    <h3><font color="green">Water as a Cooling Agent in Power, Manufacturing and Industrial Plants</font> </h3>
    <p>
        Production and manufacturing plants are the biggest sources of thermal pollution. These plants draw water from a nearby 
        source to keep machines cool and 
        then release it back to the source at higher temperatures. When heated water returns to the river or
        ocean, the water temperature rises sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different power plants are using water as their cooling agent for overly heated machinery. With that, the temperature of the
         water used to cool the machines increases, and as they are at such a high temperature, power plants send them back to the bodies of water 
         here they got their supply from.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than different powerplants, the different petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills, and other industrial 
        facilities also contribute a lot to thermal pollution. These facilities also use water to cool different machinery, and the wastewater at 
        elevated temperatures is also dumped on different bodies of water.
    </p>
    Furthermore, desalination and nuclear plants also use a lot of water for machine cooling and dump a lot of radioactive waste into different
     bodies of water. The waste from these plants, which accumulates temperature easily, also causes changes in temperature in the bodies
      of water, leading to thermal pollution.When oxygen levels are altered in the water, this can also degrade the quality and longevity
       of life in wildlife that lives underwater. This process can also wipe away streamside vegetation, which constantly depends on
        constant levels of oxygen and temperature.</p>
    
   <p> By altering these natural environments, industries are essentially helping decrease the quality of life for these marine-based life
     forms, which can ultimately destroy habitats if they are not controlled and careful about their practices.</p>

     <h3><font color="green">SOIL EROSION</font></h3>
     <img src="soil.jpg" width="320" height="250">
     <P>
        <b>Soil erosion</b> is another major factor that causes thermal pollution. Consistent soil erosion causes water bodies to rise, making 
        them more exposed to sunlight. As bodies of water are more exposed to the sun’s heat, their temperature increases.</P>

        <p>Other than the general soil erosion, once the streambanks are eroded as well, the vegetation cover within the stream might be 
        removed, further exposing the water to the thermal radiation from the sun. With that, the increase in temperature in bodies of 
        water is even faster.</p>

     </P>The high temperature could prove fatal for aquatic biomes as it may give rise to anaerobic conditions and an increase in microbial 
        activity. Furthermore, the increase in the temperature of the bodies of water could kill some species as they can’t survive in warm 
        bodies of water.

    <h3><font color="green">DEFORESATATION</font> </h3>
    <img src="forest.jpg" width="300" height="250">
    <P>
        Trees and plants prevent sunlight from falling directly on lakes, ponds, or rivers. When deforestation takes place,
        these water bodies are directly exposed to sunlight, thus absorbing more heat and raising their temperature.
    </P>
    <P>
        Aside from providing shade for different bodies of water, forests and vegetation cover are also responsible for reflecting back 
        and directly absorbing the sun’s heat. Through this, less heat will be around, preventing thermal pollution among the different 
        bodies of water near the forests.
    </P>
    <P>
        Deforestation is also the main cause of the higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, i.e., global warming in the atmosphere.
         With higher atmospheric temperatures, bodies of water also accumulate higher temperatures even faster.
