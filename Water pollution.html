        <h1>WATER POLLUTION</h1>
    </p>
    <HR Color="blue">

    <p>
        <b>Water pollution</b>, the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to
        the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. 
        In addition to the release of substances, such as chemicals, trash, or microorganisms, water pollution may also include the 
        release of energy, in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.
    </p>    
    <h2>Types of sources of Water Pollution </h2>
    <p>Water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances, including pathogenic microorganisms, putrescible organic waste, 
    fertilizers and plant nutrients, toxic chemicals, sediments, heat, petroleum (oil), and radioactive substances. 
    Several types of water pollutants are considered below.
    (For a discussion of the handling of sewage and other forms of waste produced by human activities, 
    see waste disposal and solid-waste management.

    <p><B>Domestic sewage</B> is the primary source of pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and putrescible organic substances. 
        Because pathogens are excreted in feces, all sewage from cities and towns is likely to contain pathogens of some type, 
        potentially presenting a direct threat to public health.<i> Putrescible</i> organic matter presents a different sort of threat to water quality. 
        As organics are decomposed naturally in the sewage by bacteria and other microorganisms, the dissolved oxygen content of the water is 
        depleted. This endangers the quality of lakes and streams, where high levels of oxygen are required for fish and other aquatic 
        organisms to survive. Sewage-treatment processes reduce the levels of pathogens and organics in wastewater, but they do not 
        eliminate them completely (see also wastewater treatment)</p>

    <h3><font color="red">Solid Waste</font>   </h3>
        <img src="solid.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p> The improper disposal of solid waste is a major source of water pollution. 
            Solid waste includes garbage, rubbish, electronic waste, trash, and construction and demolition waste, 
            all of which are generated by individual, residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities. 
            The problem is especially acute in developing countries that may lack infrastructure to properly dispose of solid waste or 
            that may have inadequate resources or regulation to limit improper disposal. In some places solid waste is intentionally 
            dumped into bodies of water. Land pollution can also become water pollution if the trash or other debris is carried by animals, 
            wind, or rainfall to bodies of water. Significant amounts of solid waste pollution in inland bodies of water can also eventually 
            make their way to the ocean. Solid waste pollution is unsightly and damaging to the health of aquatic ecosystems 
            and can harm wildlife directly. Many solid wastes, such as plastics and electronic waste, break down and leach harmful 
            chemicals into the water, making them a source of toxic or hazardous waste.  </p>

    <h3><font color="red">Toxic Waste</font> </h3>
        <img src="toxic.jpg"  width="300"  height="200">
        <p>Waste is considered toxic if it is poisonous, radioactive, explosive, carcinogenic<b> (causing cancer)</b>, mutagenic 
        (causing damage to chromosomes), teratogenic (causing birth defects), or bioaccumulative (that is, increasing in concentration 
        at the higher ends of food chains). Sources of toxic chemicals include improperly disposed wastewater from industrial plants 
        and chemical process facilities (lead, mercury, chromium) as well as surface runoff containing pesticides used on agricultural 
        areas and suburban lawns (chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor). (For a more-detailed treatment of toxic chemicals, see poison and toxic waste.)

    <h2>Effects of Water Pollution on ground and oceans</h2>
    <p>Groundwater—water contained in underground geologic formations called aquifers—is a source of drinking water for many people.
         For example, about half the people in the United States depend on groundwater for their domestic water supply.
          Although groundwater may appear crystal clear (due to the natural filtration that occurs as it flows slowly through layers of soil), 
          it may still be polluted by dissolved chemicals and by bacteria and viruses. Sources of chemical contaminants include poorly 
          designed or poorly maintained subsurface sewage-disposal systems (e.g., septic tanks),
           industrial wastes disposed of in improperly lined or unlined landfills or lagoons, leachates from unlined 
           municipal refuse landfills, mining and petroleum production, and leaking underground storage tanks below gasoline
            service stations. In coastal areas, increasing withdrawal of groundwater (due to urbanization and industrialization)
             can cause saltwater intrusion: as the water table drops, seawater is drawn into wells.</p>
